# cf-socketio-example

This example is based on the [demo](https://github.com/GiancarloGomez/ColdFusion-Realtime-With-WebSockets-Demo-Code) from [Giancarlo Gomez](https://github.com/GiancarloGomez).
I simple took only the needed resources and create a docker environment for it.

Run `docker-compose up -d --build` to spin up all containers.

Access: <http://localhost:443/>
